==================

 * semi working SQL adapter
 * every public API works at least partially
 * still no hooks, eager loading through join table, 
   specifying schema for adapter so you can map your own db schema.
 * still no schema creation / database introspection. 
 * not very clear what gets saved when
 * still uglyish syntax
 * still need to figure out what should be part of core
   or a standalone module.
 * still no concept of belongsTo and how it is different from hasOne
 * still no tested support for multiple primary keys
