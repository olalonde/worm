// Put all the sugar here! Helps keepings the other files clean
// from type checks, etc.
//
// for example, in index.js, we should have only
// worm.save($instance). and here we could have
// worm.save(something) which converts something to instance?
//
// or we could have a bunch of coerce functions which coerce from one
// type to the other?
//
// coerceInstance(something, arg2)
// coerceModel(something)
// coerceObj(something)
// etc.
